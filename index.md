## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/yousefm87/yoobis/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

# What do I want to build? 
A personal sandbox website platform.

# Why do I want to build this?
Experience building and deploying a website. Give myself a new avenue for growth and self-expression.

### Jekyll Themes
